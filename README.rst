===================
VistA Visualization
===================

This source tree contains a visualization of VistA packages. It is designed to
be an interactive web application that allows users to explore what packages
can be installed in a VistA instance.

-------
Purpose
-------

The current plan involves creating a database which contains all of the
registered VistA packages from anywhere including their namespace and
numberspace and associated metadata. The webapp will be driven by node.js and
a nosql database (probably an M/FileMan file at some point), currently a
mongodb is used.
